#The core practices and concepts of DevOps

##Collaboration
From Devops' point of view, this is close cooperation within the team. When developers, testers, the collection team come together and must interact to carry out the results of the analysis. It is also a close association of groups of people and software that helps build development processes. Thereby the highest quality result of a quality product.
##Automation
Automation is a key element (PipeLine) that helps developers save time, reduce errors, and increase team productivity.
##Continuous Integration
All the development work is divided into small portions for better and faster production.
It will be easier to trace the error
##Continuous Deployment
when development tasks are done, the code is committed to the repository.
There will be automatic build.
The build is installed, tested, and implemented in production and is available to the end-users.
Users only need to use what is already prepared. It reduces labor costs by yourself

#DevOps Best Practices

1. Keep code repositories regularly updated and ensure that updates are continuously integrated into the workflow
2. Build, test, and release code faster via continuous delivery
3. Build system-wide structures to facilitate configuration management, consolidating operations, and adding visibility to Information Technology leaders
4. Quickly bring in new features by taking advantage of continuous deployment tools
5. Automate dashboards to permit team members and leaders to spot bottlenecks and further investigate roadblocks quickly
6. Ensure applications have sufficient monitoring, usually automated so that development teams can quickly identify production code difficulties
