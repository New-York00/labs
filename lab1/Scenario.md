# Scenario
FordSollers team started began to use a remote repository for storing code and automatically building releases instead of the standard repository in the 1C language.


## The challenges
1. Make the code available to developers.
2. Make automated testing of the main configuration objects.
3. Make an pipe line so that the update file (cfu or cf) is assembled at the end\

## Collaboration
Increased interaction between testers and product developers, because they began to see a single process
## Automation
The number of errors has decreased due to automatic testing of the main objects
## Continuous Integration
Code made easier to track with commits
## Continuous Deployment
Due to the fact that the assembly of the final product has become automatic, the number of errors has decreased compared to manually creating an update. Human labor costs per hour have also decreased.
