## Tool name and description
Kubernetes.
Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It schedules workloads onto compute cluster nodes and actively manages them to ensure that their state matches the users’ intentions.
## Purpose and benefits of the tool in the DevOps context
	1. Kubernetes automatically provisions and fits containers into nodes for the best use of resources.
	2. Container integration and access to storage resources with different cloud providers make development, testing and deployment simpler. Creating container images — which contain everything an application needs to run.
	3. Workloads can exist in a single cloud or be spread easily across multiple cloud services. Kubernetes clusters allow the simple and accelerated migration of containerized applications from on-premises infrastructure to hybrid deployments across any cloud provider’s public cloud or private cloud infrastructure without losing any of an app’s functions or performance. That lets you move workloads to a closed or proprietary system without lock-in. 
	4. Using containers for your applications provides a lightweight way.
	5. Kubernetes schedules and automates container deployment across multiple compute nodes, whether on the public cloud.
## Key features and functionalities
	1. Service discovery and load balancing 
	2. Storage orchestration
	3. Automated rollouts and rollbacks
	4. Automatic bin packing
	5. Automation of deployment and scalability
## Use cases and examples of how the tool is used in real-world scenarios
	1. IBM Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure all offer straightforward integrations with Kubernetes-based apps.
	2. Kubernetes manage clusters for Amazon EC2, compute instances as well as run containers on these instances using processes of deployment
	3. Pokemon GO was developed and published by Niantic Inc. The game had more than 500 million downloads and more than 20 million active users. The developers did not expect such an exponential increase in users and surpass the expectations.
	They soon realized that the servers could not handle the amount of traffic they received. Then the application was run on Google Kubernetes Engine, which had the ability to orchestrate their container cluster at a manageable scale.
	This enabled the team to focus on deploying live changes for their users. GKE helped the company to not only serve, by allowing Niantic to improve their user’s experience but also add newer features to the application
