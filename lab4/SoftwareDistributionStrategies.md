Distribution is a process of delivering software from a developer to the end user.

# Different software distribution strategies and their characteristics
Distribution - it is the process of distributing software to users.
Software distribution strategies and their description:
1. Physical media: The program is written to a CD or other media.
- Advantages. If there is no Internet access, it helps to restore or install the software.
- Minuses. Delivery times for software updates may be long or not feasible at all. If the physical media is damaged (loss occurs), then either its complete replacement is required.
2. Shops selling software: Software is located on special sites. These can be package managers (for example, npm, apt), plugins (for VSCode, Notepad +), files to run from containers (Docker files)
- Minuses. Internet access required. The site may require a commission for installing or finding software.
- Advantages. Quick access to the software, regardless of the location of the user. Quick access to software updates. The site itself takes care of the security of downloading this software. Great access to the database with any software.
3. Website: The developer himself maintains a website from where you can download the software.
- Minuses. The development of the website and its further support is required.
- Advantages. The developer does not depend on anyone, and can also distribute his software through downloading files or subscriptions.
4. Cloud-based Software-as-a-Service: Users rent software on a website or server from a manufacturer.
- Minuses. The software may be paid. Internet access required.
- Advantages. The manufacturer himself configures, updates the software. Clients themselves can scale their desires depending on the needs of the software (for example, renting a server)
5. All others:
Franchisees or other campaigns that distribute the manufacturer's software through personalization and software updates.
- Minuses. payment for such services. Issue resolution speed.
- Advantages. All support (configuration, debugging, updating) does not require knowledge from the end user.
6. Pigeons.
Mmm...perhaps.

# Best practices for software distribution
Software Distribution Best Practices:
- Updates to fix emerging issues or release new features
- user support
- Licensing to protect against unauthorized access and enforce licensing terms
- clear and detailed documentation
- convenient software installation process
- convenient software update process
- several options for distributing software (possibly, but for example, everything is fine with AppleStore).
- analysis of user feedback for continuous improvement
- software development for various platforms, thereby the popularity of software among users of various platforms (IOS, Android)
